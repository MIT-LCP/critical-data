## Critical Datathon Fall 2014

Our 2nd Datathon brought together frontline healthcare providers (nurses, pharmacists, doctors) with data scientists to answer clinically-relevant questions over the course of a weekend. Participants will work with a large open-access ICU database called MIMIC, a creation of a public-private partnership between the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), MIT, and Philips Healthcare. This weekend event ran in partnership with the 41st annual international conference of Computing in Cardiology, hosted in Cambridge MA from 5-7 September, 2014
