## Datathon 2015

This weekend long (September 25-27) event brings together clinicians, data scientists and innovators in healthcare to address current problems in intensive care. The increasing wealth of patient data available through electronic health records has created a surge in research funding and industry interest in health data analytics. Challenges in extracting knowledge from health record databases, however, are significant.

The event will strengthen cross-disciplinary collaboration around secondary analysis of electronic health record data, helping to pave the way for reliable knowledge to be translated into action, for the benefit of patients.
