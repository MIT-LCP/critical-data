## 2018.HST.953: Collaborative Data Science in Medicine

*HST.953: Collaborative Data Science in Medicine* is a course that focuses on the secondary analysis of clinical data that is routinely collected in the process of care. In this fall course, students will work with Boston-area clinicians on research projects with the goal of a publication-ready manuscript at the end of the semester. Several of the papers from last 2 courses have already been published in high-impact clinical journals.

### Background

While clinical trials are best in inferring causality, they are not adept at demonstrating small effect size across a population, which is typical given heterogeneity of treatment effect. Moreover, clinical trials typically exclude important subgroups (older patients, those with chronic diseases): findings may not be generalizable to the real-world. Because of the limitations of clinical trials including cost, many practice guidelines are supported by low-quality evidence. To make matters worse, these guidelines are often adopted in countries where funding for research is limited.
The digitalization of healthcare data may provides an opportunity to develop locally relevant practice guidelines rather than adopting those that are based on research on populations that may not generalize to. Digital data is proliferating in diverse forms within the healthcare field, not only because of the adoption of electronic health records, but also because of the growing use of wireless technologies for ambulatory monitoring. Since clinical trials may be too expensive to perform in most countries, digital health data provides an opportunity to conduct locally relevant research. Rigorous observational studies have been shown to correlate well with clinical trials across the medical literature in terms of estimates of risk and effect size. The world is abuzz with applications of machine learning in almost every field – commerce, transportation, banking, and more recently, healthcare. These breakthroughs are due to rediscovered algorithms, powerful computers to run them, and most importantly, the availability of bigger and better data to train the algorithms.

### Course Information

A variety of datasets will be available, including MIMIC-III and Philips eICU from the USA. The syllabus, schedule, and more information will be coming soon. Please complete the Expression of Interest Form to be added to our mailing list and receive email notifications.


### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this course for non-matriculating MIT, Harvard and Wellesley students. For the rest, we require some experience with R, Python and/or SQL.
Everyone is required to complete an online human subjects training (if they haven’t already done so), and sign a Data User Agreement to obtain access to the MIMIC and eICU Collaborative Research Database. This is a project-based course and all the students are required to participate in clinical research using one or both of the databases.

            <p>Leo Anthony Celi, MD has practiced medicine in three continents, giving him broad perspectives in healthcare delivery. As clinical research director and principal research scientist at the MIT Laboratory of Computational Physiology (LCP), he brings together clinicians and data scientists to support research using data routinely collected in the intensive care unit (ICU). His group built and maintains the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database. This public-access database, which now holds clinical data from over 60,000 stays in BIDMC ICUs, has been meticulously de-identified and is freely shared online with the research community. It is an unparalleled research resource; over 4000 investigators from more than 30 countries have free access to the clinical data under a data use agreement. In 2016, LCP partnered with Philips eICU Research Institute to host the eICU database with more than 2 million ICU patients admitted across the United States. The goal is to scale the database globally with contributions from the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Brazil over the next year.

            Leo founded and co-directs Sana, a cross-disciplinary organization based at the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science at MIT, whose objective is to leverage information technology to improve health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. At its core is an open-source mobile tele-health platform that allows for capture, transmission and archiving of complex medical data (e.g. images, videos, physiologic signals such as ECG, EEG and oto-acoustic emission responses), in addition to patient demographic and clinical information. Sana is the inaugural recipient of both the mHealth (Mobile Health) Alliance Award from the United Nations Foundation and the Wireless Innovation Award from the Vodafone Foundation in 2010. The software has since been implemented around the globe including India, Kenya, Lebanon, Haiti, Mongolia, Uganda, Brazil, Ethiopia, Argentina, and South Africa.

            He is one of the course directors for HST.936 – global health informatics to improve quality of care, and HST.953 – secondary analysis of electronic health records, both at MIT. He is an editor of the textbook for each course, both released under an open access license.

He was born in Tokyo, grew up in Davis, California, and received an AB in biology/biochemistry from Vassar College. He has experience ranging from chemotherapeutic simulation modeling to drafting polio-eradication/global health policy proposals and has found evidence and integrating empirical methods to be a common theme in his work. He has found his calling as a potential liaison between Japan and the world, specifically to improve healthcare systems by capitalizing on his passion for management and team development. In Japan, he is currently in the process of implementing a global telemedicine platform into the field of home healthcare while also assisting the development of Japan Intensive care PAtient Database (JIPAD), Japan's largest de-identified ICU patient database that provides benchmarking for ICUs around the country. As an affiliate of MIT's Laboratory for Computational Physiology, he performs retrospective cohort studies and applies predictive approaches for improving patient care. In his spare time, he works to facilitate international partnerships, and is currently in the process of setting up a base in Japan for Global Citizen, a movement of engaged citizens using their collective voice to end extreme poverty by 2030.
