# Upcoming Courses

## 2018.HST.953: Collaborative Data Science in Medicine

*HST.953: Collaborative Data Science in Medicine* focuses on the secondary analysis of clinical data that is routinely collected in the process of care. In this fall course, students will work with Boston-area clinicians on research projects with the goal of a publication-ready manuscript at the end of the semester. Several of the papers from last 2 courses have already been published in high-impact clinical journals.

### Background

While clinical trials are best in inferring causality, they are not adept at demonstrating small effect size across a population, which is typical given heterogeneity of treatment effect. Moreover, clinical trials typically exclude important subgroups (older patients, those with chronic diseases): findings may not be generalizable to the real-world. Because of the limitations of clinical trials including cost, many practice guidelines are supported by low-quality evidence. To make matters worse, these guidelines are often adopted in countries where funding for research is limited.
The digitalization of healthcare data may provides an opportunity to develop locally relevant practice guidelines rather than adopting those that are based on research on populations that may not generalize to. Digital data is proliferating in diverse forms within the healthcare field, not only because of the adoption of electronic health records, but also because of the growing use of wireless technologies for ambulatory monitoring. Since clinical trials may be too expensive to perform in most countries, digital health data provides an opportunity to conduct locally relevant research. Rigorous observational studies have been shown to correlate well with clinical trials across the medical literature in terms of estimates of risk and effect size. The world is abuzz with applications of machine learning in almost every field – commerce, transportation, banking, and more recently, healthcare. These breakthroughs are due to rediscovered algorithms, powerful computers to run them, and most importantly, the availability of bigger and better data to train the algorithms.

### Course Information

A variety of datasets will be available, including MIMIC-III and Philips eICU from the USA. The syllabus, schedule, and more information will be coming soon. Please complete the Expression of Interest Form to be added to our mailing list and receive email notifications.


### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this course for non-matriculating MIT, Harvard and Wellesley students. For the rest, we require some experience with R, Python and/or SQL.
Everyone is required to complete an online human subjects training (if they haven’t already done so), and sign a Data User Agreement to obtain access to the MIMIC and eICU Collaborative Research Database. This is a project-based course and all the students are required to participate in clinical research using one or both of the databases.

        Julian Euma Ishii-Rousseau, or "Euma", is a medical student at Tokyo Medical and Dental University. Euma was born in Tokyo, grew up in Davis, California, and received an AB in biology/biochemistry from Vassar College. Euma has experience ranging from chemotherapeutic simulation modeling to drafting polio-eradication/global health policy proposals, and has found evidence and integrating empirical methods to be a common theme in his work. He has found his calling as a potential liaison between Japan and the world, specifically to improve healthcare systems by capitalizing on his passion for management and team development. In Japan, Euma is currently in the process of implementing an international telemedicine platform into the field of home healthcare while also assisting the development of Japan Intensive care PAtient Database (JIPAD), Japan's largest de-identified ICU patient database that provides benchmarking for ICUs around the country. As an affiliate of MIT's Laboratory for Computational Physiology, he currently is the HST 953 organizer/coordinator. He also performs retrospective cohort studies as well as NLP/ML predictions, and will be faculty for the NY Datathon this fall, and the Kyoto Datathon in March 2019.
